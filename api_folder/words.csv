It models the actions (or behaviors) performed by the components of a business process or IT system, the order in which the actions take place, and the conditions that coordinate the actions in a specific order. Activity diagrams use swim lanes to group actions together. Actions can be grouped by the actor performing the action or by the distinct business process or system that is performing the action."
Actor,The human and nonhuman roles that interact with a system
Agile,"Agile is a general term and conceptual framework used to describe a number of “light-weight” methodologies, such as Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM, Kanban, and Rapid Application Development (RAD), which exhibit a series of common characteristics. Some of these characteristics include iterative analysis and development, time-boxed iterations of a predefined length, delivery of the most critical features and functions first, delivery of a complete build with an initial set of limited features within a few months (often 1-2 months), small cross-functional teams usually of 6-9 team members, daily team communication meetings, and reduced levels of documentation."
Agile Mindset,"A set of attitudes supporting an agile working environment; respect, collaboration, improvement, and learning cycles."
Alternative Flow,An alternate flow describes a use case scenario other than the basic flow that results in a user completing his or her goal. It is often considered to be an optional flow and implies that the user has chosen to take an alternative path through the system.

Business constraints describe limitations on available solutions or an aspect of the current state that cannot be changed by the deployment of the new solution. See also technical constraint.
Business Entity Model,"A business entity model is a logical model that documents the entities, or things, that a business or business process uses and interacts with in order to accomplish its business activities and goals. In addition to documenting entities, a business entity model may capture the attributes of an entity, relationships between entities, and cardinality information. Many business entity models are created in the form of a UML class diagram."
Business Goal,A state or condition the business must satisfy to reach its vision.
Business Needs,"A type of high-level business requirement that is a statement of a business objective, or an impact the solution should have on its environment."
Business Process,A process that is owned and carried out by the business. Contributes to the delivery of a product or service to a business customer.

Certification of Competency in Business Analysis (CCBA),The Certification of Competency in Business Analysis (CCBA) is the designation given to those professionals who sit for and pass the CCBA exam. The CCBA is an intermediate stepping stone for those business analysts who do not meet the more stringent requirements of the CBAP.
