0,"Just wondering about the consultation process, where day to day running's of some organizations may be affected by some changes to be implemented or trialed. ",Gore 
1,"Morning - the Streets Alive team has been talking with business owners in Irk Street and has developed a trial for that area largely based on the feedback they gave us. We will be talking with them again this week, as well as talking with business owners in West Gore on Monday who will have a Streets Alive trial near their premises. The trials are aimed at getting people out on to the streets, so this should mean more foot traffic for businesses in some instances. Many thanks ",GoreDC
2,"Seeing the art going up around Gore is amazing. It really helps bring some life into the community, however it would be nice if the murals had meaning and a relationship to Gore in some way, is there some kind of space to explain the murals? ",JB
3,Hi JB - the Council is working with the artists to get a pamphlet about the art trail created. We will also put information on GoreNZ. ,GoreDC
4,Love love love the art work around town. Brilliant. Hope its here to stay,Jor
5,"I love the art around town, this brightens up the place a lot and potentially MORE blanks walls should be done.<div>I think turning Anzac St into a 1 way street will be good. I live on Anzac and as annoying as it might be to adjust I think it will definitely make it safer especially for the school kids as I get pretty worried for them in the afternoon as it's just chaos. Likewise I think the school bus hub can only be a good thing as those buses create hazardous lack of visibility and congestion.</div><div>The roundabouts are a good idea particularly along Broughton St.</div><div>I'm looking forward to the changes on Irk St as I think that should definitely be a more pedestrian friendly zone.</div><div>I think the wayfinding and play trail ideas are a great way to cater to kids and tourists and encourage people to get out and explore more.</div><div>I also think the mini parks and spaces are a good idea, although I'm of the opinion we actually also need a youth centre in our long term plan as there are not enough spaces for youth to go and engage themselves and we need safe indoor spaces where they can go and hang out preferably with youth workers supporting them, but the outdoor spaces are a good start.</div>",LWilliams
6,I understand reducing the width of roads slows traffic down but what does this mean for safety of cyclists using same roads?,Buzz
7,"Sorry to disagree with the amount of traffic along Broughton street, Anzac street, Pomona street .  Severn days a week i walk  these streets and at peak times, the most cars i,ve ever seen having to cross these streets is three , all cars just pull out onto Broughton steet  in nice orderly fashion. Do we have 20/30 thousand people here in Gore? Err you would be pushing three thousand, the traffic is very light at most times, yes there is the buses who do a wonderful job getting our kids to school on time and pulling in and out at Gore high school can be traumatic, again its US drivers who need to slow down and give the buses time to do there job. Creating these ""Jelly bean "" islands is a complete waste of time and MONEY. Perhaps teaching the kids to pick the litter up they create is more useful. Every Tuesday / Wednesday i pick up countless items, from bottles- cans- chip bags-KFC boxes- McDonalds the list goes on ,yes what a great idea to get people back out onto the streets. !  Yes the new paintings on drab walls look good, and our flower beds magnificent, well done for that . Trying to put more plant pots along IRK street and crossings is only going to drive people away-- how many accidents have we had along this road ? All the plant pots do is hold up foot traffic, yes they look nice but are they worth it . People only chuck rubbish into them, unless our attitude on waste changes.  Sorry again about the moan. But this what happens. Yes the best idea i,ve seen to date was give that 100,000 of rate payers money back to the RATE payers as a discount !!!!! OK .",Riddings123
8,"Morning - thanks to both of you for the feedback, we look forward to hearing what you think after the trials have been in place for a few weeks. ",GoreDC
9,"Hi - the roads won't be narrower for cyclists, we are more reapportioning the existing space by making more room on the left side for parking and cyclists. Hope that makes sense :)<div>  </div>",GoreDC
